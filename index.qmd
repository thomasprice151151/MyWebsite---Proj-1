Hi! My name is Thomas Price and I am a current Senior at Pitzer College. At Pitzer, I study International Political Economy and Data Science. When I am not studying, you can find me playing tennis on our club tennis team, traveling around the country with the Claremont Debate Team or winning intramural Pickle ball Tournaments!\
\
Being From San Francisco, I am a huge Giants fan, so if you support any LA team, kindly leave this website
