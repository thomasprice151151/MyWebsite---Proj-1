Their is a general upward trend where countries with longer life expectancy tend to have higher incomes. Additionally, their is noticeable variation within continents. Some countries achieve high life expectancy despite modest GDP per capita, and others show the opposite.This graph warrants testing whether the relationship is strong enough to be considered statistically meaningful.\n\n\nCode\n#Identifying the LifeExp slope with a linear model\n\nget_slope &lt;- function(df) {\n  fit &lt;- lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp, data = df)\n  coef(fit)[[\"lifeExp\"]]  \n}\n\n\nThe code above tests the slope of the simple regression. gdpPercap ~ lifeExp\nNull : beta1 = 0 Alt : beta1 ≠ 0\n\n\nCode\nobs_slopes &lt;- gap2007 |&gt;\n  group_by(continent) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    obs_slope = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp))[2]\n  )\n\nobs_slopes\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  continent obs_slope\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa         145.\n2 Americas      1293.\n3 Asia          1225.\n4 Europe        3366.\n5 Oceania       8972.\n\n\nCode\ncontinents &lt;- unique(gap2007$continent)\n\nobs_slopes_continent &lt;- numeric(length(continents))\n\nfor (i in 1:length(continents)) {\n  df_cont &lt;- subset(gap2007, continent == continents[i])\n  \n  obs_slopes_continent[i] &lt;- get_slope(df_cont)\n}\n\nnames(obs_slopes_continent) &lt;- continents\n\nobs_slope_overall &lt;- get_slope(gap2007)\nobs_slope_overall\n\n\n[1] 722.8975\n\n\nCode\nobs_slopes_continent\n\n\n     Asia    Europe    Africa  Americas   Oceania \n1225.2852 3365.9658  144.5327 1292.5570 8972.2195 \n\n\nThe above code uses a for loop to compute the observed slope for each continent. For each iteration, the code filtered the data set to a single continent, ran the get_slope() function and saved the slope value. This allows me to compare how the strength of the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita differs geographically.Given the slope output, we can predict the average change in GDP per capita (US$) for a 1 year increase in life. For example in Asia, we can predict 1 additional year of life yields 1225.2 additional gdp per capita.\nLarger positive slopes signify a steeper income to health relationship.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test : Null Distribution\nperm_null &lt;- function(rep, data){\n  data |&gt;\n    select(continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap) |&gt;\n    mutate(lifeExp_perm = sample(lifeExp, replace = FALSE)) |&gt;\n    group_by(continent) |&gt;\n    summarize(\n      obs_slope  = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp      ))[2],\n      perm_slope = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp_perm ))[2],\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    mutate(rep = rep)\n}\n\nset.seed(2025)\nB &lt;- 2000\n\n\nnull_by_cont_tbl &lt;- map(1:B, perm_null, data = gap2007) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\nhead(null_by_cont_tbl)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  continent obs_slope perm_slope   rep\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Africa         145.      11.0      1\n2 Americas      1293.     257.       1\n3 Asia          1225.    -137.       1\n4 Europe        3366.     250.       1\n5 Oceania       8972.   -1476.       1\n6 Africa         145.       2.88     2\n\n\nTo simulate the null hypothesis that life expectancy and GDP per capita are unrelated, I created a permutation function. The function (perm_null) randomly shuffles life expectancy values within the dataset. For each randomization, a linear model is fit for each continent and the new slope is recorded. Repeating this 2,000 times using the map() function creates a null distribution of slopes that would occur purely by chance.\n\n\nCode\n#Calculating P-Values per continent \n\npvals_tbl &lt;- null_by_cont_tbl |&gt;\n  group_by(continent) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    obs_slope = first(obs_slope), \n    p_value = mean(abs(perm_slope) &gt;= abs(obs_slope))\n  )\n\npvals_tbl\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  continent obs_slope p_value\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa         145.  0.0005\n2 Americas      1293.  0     \n3 Asia          1225.  0     \n4 Europe        3366.  0     \n5 Oceania       8972.  0.0685\n\n\nThe permutation results show that the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita is statistically significant in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. The effect in Africa is far smaller which may indicate that economic development does not translate into health outcomes as consistently there as it does in other parts of the world. Oceania shows a non-significant results because only two countries are present, making any estimate unstable. Overall, the analysis suggests that while income and health are positively related worldwide, the strength of this relationship varies by region.\n\n\nCode\n#Plotting -- Faceted null distribution plots \n\nobs_slopes &lt;- gap2007 |&gt;\n  group_by(continent) |&gt;\n  summarize(obs_slope = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp))[2], .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(\n    data = null_by_cont_tbl,\n    aes(x = perm_slope),\n    bins = 40, fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = obs_slopes,\n    aes(xintercept = obs_slope),\n    color = \"red\", linewidth = 1.2\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ continent, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Permutation Test: Null Distribution of Slopes by Continent\",\n    subtitle = \"Red line = observed slope; histogram = null slopes (lifeExp shuffled)\",\n    x = \"Permuted slopes\", y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histograms show slopes expected by chance if life expectancy and GDP were unrelated, while the red lines show the true slopes. In Asia, Europe, and the Americas, the observed slopes fall far outside the null distributions, indicating a strong real relationship. Africa shows a weaker but still significant effect. Oceania does not show significance because it includes only two countries, making its estimate unreliable.\nConclusion:\nThis simulation study provides strong evidence of a positive relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita worldwide. However, this strength of correlation is dependent on region. Europe, Asia and the Americas show a strong and significant relationship. Africa shows a weaker, yet still significant connection. Oceania’s results are not meaningfull due to having only two countries in the dataset. Overall, economic development and improved health outcomes appear linked globally, but the degree of the link is highly dependent on regional context."

This specific table shows, the date of the tweet, the source, the text of the tweet, if it was re-tweeted, and any urls within the tweet. The cleaning function we did removes any rows where the tweet text is missing, and does some basic cleaning by making all the text lowercase and getting rid of any line breaks.\n\n\nCode\n# Identifying tweets that contain links and government links. \n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\ntweets_table &lt;- tweets |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    created_at = timestamp,\n    has_link = !is.na(expanded_urls),\n\n    gov_link = str_detect(expanded_urls, \"(?&lt;=https?://)[^\\\\s]*\\\\.gov\"), has_http_in_text = str_detect(text, \"https?://[^\\\\s]+\")) |&gt;\n     select(created_at, text, has_link, gov_link, has_http_in_text)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Creating a new table with those links \n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n\ntweets_table |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_tweets = n(),\n    with_links = sum(has_link),\n    pct_with_links = mean(has_link),\n    pct_gov_of_links = mean(gov_link[has_link], na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  total_tweets with_links pct_with_links pct_gov_of_links\n         &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          321        135          0.421            0.126\n\n\nThis table showcases the total number of tweets that Obama posted during his short Twitter tenure. The table highlights tweets that contained links, and further identifies the percentage of those links that directed users to government websites.

Given that Twitter is a relatively new medium to disseminate critical information, I would like to do further analysis to see if more recent officials have used it to push government resources. Ultimately comparing usage across different administrations."
