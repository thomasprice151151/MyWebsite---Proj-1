He had a total of 325 tweets through is 2 year Twitter tenure. Moving forward, we will continue to clean the data to identify what the nature of his tweets where, specifically targeting those that had links in them. This specific table shows, the date of the tweet, the source, the text of the tweet, if it was re-tweeted, and any urls within the tweet. The cleaning function we did removes any rows where the tweet text is missing, and does some basic cleaning by making all the text lowercase and getting rid of any line breaks.\n\n\nCode\n# Identifying tweets that contain links and government links. \n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\ntweets_table &lt;- tweets |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    created_at = timestamp,\n    has_link = !is.na(expanded_urls),\n\n    gov_link = str_detect(expanded_urls, \"(?&lt;=https?://)[^\\\\s]*\\\\.gov\"), has_http_in_text = str_detect(text, \"https?://[^\\\\s]+\")) |&gt;\n     select(created_at, text, has_link, gov_link, has_http_in_text)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Creating a new table with those links \n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n\ntweets_table |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_tweets = n(),\n    with_links = sum(has_link),\n    pct_with_links = mean(has_link),\n    pct_gov_of_links = mean(gov_link[has_link], na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  total_tweets with_links pct_with_links pct_gov_of_links\n         &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          321        135          0.421            0.126\n\n\nThis table showcases the total number of tweets that Obama posted during his short Twitter tenure. The table highlights tweets that contained links, and further identifies the percentage of those links that directed users to government websites. We can see that there were a total of 321 tweets, 135 of which contained links (42%). Among those tweets, 12.5% included links to government websites.\n\n\nCode\n#Visualizing which tweets contained links vs Gov links\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nlinks_summary &lt;- tweets_table |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    with_links = sum(has_link, na.rm = TRUE),\n    with_gov_links = sum(gov_link, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"type\", values_to = \"count\")\n\nggplot(links_summary, aes(x = type, y = count, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Obama Tweets Containing .Gov and Non .Gov Links\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Number of Tweets\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"steelblue\", \"darkred\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above showcases that table data above. We can see the total amount of tweets that contained links, and the total amount that contained government links. As seen only a small percentage where gov links. Given that Twitter is a relatively new medium to disseminate critical information, I would like to do further analysis to see if more recent officials have used it to push government resources. Ultimately comparing usage across different administrations."
